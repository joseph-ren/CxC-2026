# Frontend (Next.js + Tailwind)

This folder contains a minimal Next.js app styled with Tailwind. It fetches listings from the Flask backend at `http://localhost:5000/api/listings`.

Quick start

1. cd frontend
2. Install dependencies: `npm install` (or `pnpm`/`yarn`)
3. Run the dev server: `npm run dev`

Notes
- To use the full shadcn/ui toolset, run `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest create` and follow the prompts. That will scaffold a more complete component library and theme setup.
